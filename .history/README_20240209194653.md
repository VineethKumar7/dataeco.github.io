# Data Hosting Cost Analysis Project

## About the Project

This repository documents our exploration into hosting large datasets on AWS S3, assessing the cost implications of storage size and download frequency. Our goal is to find a cost-efficient method to make datasets available for academic and research purposes.

### Key Findings:

- Storage size significantly affects cost, more so than the number of get requests.
- Possibilities for leveraging educational discounts and collaborations to offset costs.

### Future Directions:

- Further analysis of cost-saving strategies for data hosting.
- Exploration of partnerships for educational or research benefits.

Stay tuned for updates on our findings and methodologies.
